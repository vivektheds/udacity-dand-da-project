# Intro to Data Analysis Final Project

This is the second project for the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. This project
focuses on the skills taught in the [Intro to Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-data-analysis--ud170-nd)
course, but also incorporates skills from the [Statistics](https://www.udacity.com/course/statistics--ud134-nd)
course. For the project, we were asked to analyse a dataset with statistical
analysis and using Python's NumPy and Pandas libraries as tools for working with
the data. The dataset used is the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).
